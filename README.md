## About This Project

The Movie Recommendation System is a fully functional, modern web application built using ReactJS and Next.js. It provides an interactive platform for users to search for movies and explore their details in a visually appealing, Netflix-style interface.

This project was developed to demonstrate practical front-end development skills, API integration, and responsive UI/UX design using modern web technologies. By leveraging the OMDb API, the application fetches real-time movie data, including titles, posters, and release years, allowing users to discover and explore movies efficiently.

Key Features and Highlights:

Interactive Movie Search: Users can search for any movie title. The application fetches results dynamically from the OMDb API and displays them in real-time.

Responsive Netflix-style Layout: Movie results are displayed in a grid layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Light/Dark Theme Toggle: Inspired by Netflix’s UI, users can switch between dark mode and light mode with smooth transitions for a more personalized experience.

Visual Enhancements: Includes hover effects, zoom-in animations on movie posters, and glow effects to make the UI more engaging and interactive.

Next.js Integration: By migrating the app to Next.js, the project benefits from server-side rendering, better SEO support, and easier deployment options while still using ReactJS for interactive components.

Loading Animations: A loading spinner provides visual feedback when data is being fetched from the API, enhancing user experience.

This project is a great example of combining ReactJS for dynamic UI, Next.js for performance and SEO, and API integration for real-world data. It can be extended further with features such as movie detail pages, pagination, user favorites, and additional APIs for richer functionality.

The Movie Recommendation System serves as a portfolio-ready project showcasing modern web development practices, responsive design, and a professional UI experience similar to popular streaming platforms.
